# Daniel's Personal Portfolio

## Daniel's Personal Portfolio Website

## Overview
This application is used to display my personal software development portfolio. When you navigate to my personal portfolio website, 
you will be presented with a short description of myself, some projects that I've worked on, and some information on how to get in 
contact with me. The portfolio only has a few of my projects so I would definitely recommend looking through my Github profile to look
at all the projects that I've worked on.

### Student Notes
I decided to use bootstrap to make to make it easier to format some of the HTML elements on my webpage. This helped tremendously when it comes to formatting the images that point to my projects.
